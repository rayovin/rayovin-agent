**The native desktop app for [Rayovin Agent](../../README.md) — the intelligent Persian AI agent by نبض آینده جنوب from [نبض آینده جنوب (Nabz-e-Ayandeh-e-Jonoob)](https://rayovin.com).** Same agent, same skills, same memory as the CLI and gateway, in a polished native window — chat with streaming tool output, side-by-side previews, a file browser, voice, and settings, no terminal required. Available for **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

<table>
<tr><td><b>Chat with the full agent</b></td><td>Streaming responses, live tool activity, structured tool summaries, and the same conversation history as every other Rayovin surface.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Side-by-side previews</b></td><td>Render web pages, files, and tool outputs in a right-hand pane while you keep chatting.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>File browser</b></td><td>Explore and preview the working directory without leaving the app.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Voice</b></td><td>Talk to Rayovin and hear it back.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Settings & onboarding</b></td><td>Manage providers, models, tools, and credentials from a real UI. First-run setup gets you to your first message in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Stays current</b></td><td>Built-in updates pull the latest agent and rebuild the app in place.</td></tr>

## Install

### Install with Rayovin (recommended)

Already have the Rayovin CLI? Just run:

```bash
rayovin desktop
```

It builds and launches the GUI against your existing install — same config, keys, sessions, and skills. On first launch Rayovin walks you through picking a provider and model; nothing else to configure.

### Prebuilt installers

Prebuilt installers are built and distributed via [the Rayovin Desktop website.](https://rayovin-agent.rayovin.com/).

---

## Updating

The app checks for updates in the background and offers a one-click update when one is ready. You can also update any time from the CLI:

```bash
rayovin update
```

---

## Requirements

The installer handles everything for you (Python 3.11+, a portable Git, ripgrep).

---

## Development

Want to hack on the app itself? Install workspace deps from the repo root once, then run the dev server from this directory:

```bash
npm install          # from repo root — links apps/desktop, web, apps/shared
cd apps/desktop
npm run dev          # Vite renderer + Electron, which boots the Python backend
```

Point the app at a specific source checkout, or sandbox it away from your real config:

```bash
# throwaway RAYOVIN_HOME, separate Electron userData, distinct app name to avoid the single-instance lock
../scripts/dev-sandbox.sh npm run dev
RAYOVIN_DESKTOP_RAYOVIN_ROOT=/path/to/clone npm run dev
RAYOVIN_HOME=/tmp/throwaway npm run dev
npm run dev:fake-boot   # exercise the startup overlay with deterministic delays
```

### Building installers

```bash
npm run dist:mac     # DMG + zip
npm run dist:win     # NSIS + MSI
npm run dist:linux   # AppImage + deb + rpm
npm run pack         # unpacked app under release/ (no installer)
```

Installers are built and uploaded to GitHub Releases manually. macOS/Windows signing & notarization happen automatically when the relevant credentials are present in the environment (`CSC_LINK` / `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_*` for macOS, `WIN_CSC_*` for Windows).

### How it works

The packaged app ships the Electron shell and a native React chat surface. On
first launch it can install the Rayovin Agent runtime into `RAYOVIN_HOME`
(`~/.rayovin`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rayovin` on Windows), using the same layout as a
CLI install.

The app has three boundaries:

- **Electron** resolves and validates a runnable backend, owns native
  filesystem/git/window capabilities, and exposes a narrow preload bridge.
- **React** owns the Desktop routes, panes, interaction state, and
  `@assistant-ui/react` transcript.
- **Rayovin Agent** runs as a headless `rayovin serve` process and exposes the
  `tui_gateway` JSON-RPC/WebSocket API. The renderer connects through
  [`apps/shared`](../shared/), which is also used by the browser dashboard.

Backend resolution is an ordered ladder:

1. `RAYOVIN_DESKTOP_RAYOVIN_ROOT`
2. the current source checkout during development
3. a completed managed install
4. `RAYOVIN_DESKTOP_RAYOVIN`, or `rayovin` on `PATH`
5. a system Python that can import the Rayovin runtime
6. the first-launch bootstrap installer

Candidates are probed before use; an existing shim or interpreter is not enough.
A runtime that predates `serve` falls back to headless
`dashboard --no-open`. This is compatibility for the backend command only and
does not launch or embed the dashboard UI.

The Electron orchestration entry point is `electron/main.ts`; pure resolution,
probe, hardening, and platform policies live in focused modules beside it. The
renderer is under `src/`, with shared atoms in `src/store` and transport/native
adapters in `src/lib`.

Before changing the app, read:

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md): architecture, state ownership, resolver/fallback,
  transport, performance, and testing rules.
- [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md): visual system, information architecture, motion,
  direct manipulation, and keyboard behavior.

### Connections, projects, and switching

Desktop supports a managed local backend, explicit remote gateways, and Rayovin
Cloud connections. Remote and cloud modes use the same remote-capability path;
authentication and discovery differ, not the renderer feature model.

Projects are the workspace abstraction. A project may own multiple folders,
repositories, worktrees, and sessions; a bare new chat remains detached unless
the user enters a project or configures a default project directory. Use the
Projects UI rather than adding a second per-session folder-picker workflow.

Changing profiles or connection modes is a soft workspace switch, not another
cold boot. The shell and current management overlay remain mounted while
gateway-bound nanostores are wiped, query-backed data is invalidated, and the
new connection repopulates skeletons. This prevents rows or transcripts from
the previous gateway bleeding into the next one.

### Verification

Run before opening a PR (lint may surface pre-existing warnings but must exit cleanly):

```bash
npm run fix
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:ui
npm run test:desktop:platforms
```

Run `npm run test:desktop:all` for install, boot, update, packaging, or other
release-path changes.

### Troubleshooting

Boot logs land in `RAYOVIN_HOME/logs/desktop.log` (includes backend output and recent Python tracebacks) — check it first if the app reports a boot failure.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# Force a clean first-launch setup
rm "$HOME/.rayovin/rayovin-agent/.rayovin-bootstrap-complete"
# Rebuild a broken Python venv
rm -rf "$HOME/.rayovin/rayovin-agent/venv"
# Reset a stuck macOS microphone prompt (macOS only)
tccutil reset Microphone com.rayovin.rayovin
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Force a clean first-launch setup
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\rayovin\rayovin-agent\.rayovin-bootstrap-complete"
# Rebuild a broken Python venv
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\rayovin\rayovin-agent\venv"
```

> The default Rayovin home on Windows is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rayovin`. Set the `RAYOVIN_HOME` env var if you've relocated it.
